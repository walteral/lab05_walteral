### Geovisualization:
For this lab I am using the Transnational Freshwater Dispute Database to display different attributes of the databsae. To start I have a landing page with links to an about modal, a credit modal, the github page and a facebook page. Next as you continue to scroll down I wanted to show how the difference between population and land area of a basin can affect the relationship between the countries that share basins. To do this I created a donut chart that shows the distribution of basins by their population densities. The second chart that I displayed is the land area for each basin in a bar chart. The third visualization is simplier but harder to display, a chart showing the names and information about the different basins based on the DC filters applied. 

### Patterns:
Using the geovisuization techniques we are able to determine that over half of the transnational basins have a population density of 50 people per square kilometer or less. Another pattern of note is that the areas for the basins are significantly large or significantly small. There are not a large amount of medium sized basins. Using the equal internal categorizaions the two largest categories are those with less than 10,000 km2 and those with >50,000 km2.
